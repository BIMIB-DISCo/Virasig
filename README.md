# Virasig

A user friendly, "dockerized" pipeline framework to integrate
high-confidence SNVs calling for different viruses (e.g., HIV,
SARS-CoV-2, HPV, ...), in order to use them to characterize Mutational
Signatures and related evolutionary processes.  *Virasig* provides
encapsulating code layers for existing "single-virus" pipelines already
available.
